# Software Architecture Assignment: Custom Python ETL Data Connector

Welcome to the official repository for submitting your Software Architecture assignment on building custom data connectors (ETL pipelines) in Python. This assignment is part of the Kyureeus EdTech program for SSN CSE students.

Guideline: Building and Managing Custom Data Connectors (ETL Pipeline) in Python

1. Setting Up the Connector Environment
a. Choose Your API Provider: Identify a data provider and understand its Base URL, Endpoints, and Authentication.
b. Understand the API Documentation: Focus on headers, query params, pagination, rate limits, and response structure.


2. Secure API Authentication Using Environment Variables
a. Create a `.env` File Locally: Store API keys and secrets as KEY=VALUE pairs.
b. Load Environment Variables in Code: Use libraries like `dotenv` to securely load environment variables.


3. Design the ETL Pipeline
Extract: Connect to the API, pass tokens/headers, and collect JSON data.
Transform: Clean or reformat the data for MongoDB compatibility.
Load: Store the transformed data into a MongoDB collection.


4. MongoDB Collection Strategy
Use one collection per connector, e.g., `connector_name_raw`.
Store ingestion timestamps to support audits or updates.


5. Iterative Testing & Validation
Test for invalid responses, empty payloads, rate limits, and connectivity errors.
Ensure consistent insertion into MongoDB.


6. Git and Project Structure Guidelines
a. Use a Central Git Repository: Clone the shared repo and create a new branch for your connector.
b. Ignore Secrets: Add `.env` to `.gitignore` before the first commit.
c. Push and Document: Write README.md with endpoint details, API usage, and example output.


Final Checklist for Students
Understand API documentation
Secure credentials in `.env`
Build complete ETL script
Validate MongoDB inserts
Push code to your branch
Include descriptive README
Submit Pull Request

## 📋 Assignment Overview

**Goal:**  
Develop a Python script to connect with an API provider, extract data, transform it for compatibility, and load it into a MongoDB collection. Follow secure coding and project structure practices as outlined below.

## 📦 Project Structure

/your-branch-name/
├── etl_connector.py
├── .env
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
└── (any additional scripts or configs)


- **`.env`**: Store sensitive credentials; do **not** commit this file.
- **`etl_connector.py`**: Your main ETL script.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List all Python dependencies.
- **`README.md`**: Instructions for your connector.

---

## 🛡️ Secure Authentication

- Store all API keys/secrets in a local `.env` file.
- Load credentials using the `dotenv` Python library.
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` before committing.

---

## 🗃️ MongoDB Guidelines

- Use one MongoDB collection per connector (e.g., `connectorname_raw`).
- Store ingestion timestamps for audit and update purposes.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Check for invalid responses, empty payloads, rate limits, and connectivity issues.
- Ensure data is correctly inserted into MongoDB.

---

## 📝 Git & Submission Guidelines

1. **Clone the repository** and create your own branch.
2. **Add your code and documentation** in your folder/branch.
3. **Do not commit** your `.env` or secrets.
4. **Write clear commit messages** (include your name and roll number).
5. **Submit a Pull Request** when done.
